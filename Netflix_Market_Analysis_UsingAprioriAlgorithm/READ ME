# Analyzing Netflix's Market Position Within the Global OTT Ecosystem with Competitive Benchmarks

## Author: [Your Name]

## Overview

This project analyzes Netflix's market performance from 2017 to 2021, focusing on revenue growth, subscriber trends, content strategy, and regional penetration. By leveraging unsupervised machine learning techniques, specifically the Apriori algorithm, the project uncovers viewing patterns across four regions (U.S.A. and Canada, Latin America, Europe, Middle East, and Africa, and Asia Pacific) over five years. The analysis compares Netflix with Amazon Prime as a benchmark competitor, providing insights into genre preferences, regional strategies, and opportunities for growth. A Power BI dashboard visualizes key metrics, including content distribution, subscriber growth, and revenue trends, to support data-driven decision-making for optimizing Netflix's content, pricing, and regional strategies.

## Dataset Overview

The analysis integrates data from 25 diverse sources, including Kaggle datasets, IMDb non-commercial datasets, and industry reports. The dataset covers:
- **Content Features**: Titles, genres, ratings, and release years.
- **Subscriber Data**: Regional subscriber counts and growth trends.
- **Revenue Metrics**: Year-over-year revenue for Netflix and Amazon Prime.
- **Regional Distribution**: Viewing patterns across four regions (U.S.A. and Canada, Latin America, Europe, Middle East, and Africa, Asia Pacific).
- **Competitive Benchmarking**: Content and performance metrics for Amazon Prime.

Key datasets include:
- IMDb OTT Platforms Movies
- Netflix OTT Revenue and Subscribers
- Netflix Engagement Report
- Movies on Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, and Disney
- Netflix Original Films IMDb Scores
- Netflix User Statistics

## Data Preprocessing

Extensive data wrangling was performed to prepare the datasets for analysis:

1. **Data Integration**: Combined 25 datasets using joins on common fields like movie titles. For example, `most-popular_global_weekly.xlsx` was merged with IMDb data using the `Title` column.
2. **Column Filtering**: Removed irrelevant columns (e.g., `season_title`, `country_iso2`, `Poster`, `Metascore`) to reduce noise.
3. **Handling Missing Data**: Applied `na.omit()` to remove rows with missing values.
4. **Data Transformation**:
   - Categorized movie ratings into four age groups (Kids, Teens, Adults, Older) using a custom `categorize_age` function.
   - Grouped countries into four regions using `case_when`.
   - Converted date formats to extract years and created transaction IDs based on region and date.
5. **Feature Engineering**: Aggregated genres per transaction (region-year combination) for the Apriori algorithm.

## Modeling

The project employs the **Apriori algorithm** to uncover association rules in viewing patterns:

- **Algorithm**: Apriori identified frequent genre combinations watched in each region-year combination.
- **Parameters**:
  - Minimum support: 0.10
  - Minimum confidence: 0.33
  - Minimum rule length: 2
- **Process**:
  - Grouped data by region, year, and transaction ID.
  - Created transactions from genre lists using the `arules` package.
  - Generated rules for each region-year, filtered to avoid duplicates.
  - Selected top 5 rules per region-year based on lift.

The output includes rules, support, confidence, and lift metrics, saved as `rules_apriori_top5.csv`.

## Visualization and Page Interpretations

A Power BI dashboard visualizes key insights across six pages. Below are detailed interpretations for each page.

### Page 1: Overview

**Content**: Introduces the analysis of Netflix's performance from 2017 to 2021, focusing on revenue growth, subscriber trends, content strategy, and regional distribution, with Amazon Prime as a benchmark.

**Interpretation**:
- Provides a high-level summary of Netflix's evolution in the OTT ecosystem.
- Highlights the use of data storytelling and pattern recognition to guide strategic decisions.
- Sets the stage for detailed analyses, emphasizing Netflix's competitive positioning and growth opportunities.

### Page 2: Content Strategy & Regional Penetration

**Content**: Displays a pie chart of Netflix content distribution by category (15.92% Netflix Exclusive, 16.39% Netflix Original, remainder non-original) and a line graph of subscriber growth by region over time.

**Interpretation**:
- The pie chart reveals Netflix's investment in originals and exclusives, which constitute roughly a third of its content, driving viewer engagement.
- The line graph shows significant subscriber growth in Europe, Middle East, and Africa, and Asia Pacific, indicating high market potential in these regions.
- Suggests Netflix should prioritize original content to maintain competitive edge and tailor regional strategies to capitalize on subscriber trends.

### Page 3: Generational Segment & Viewership

**Content**: Likely includes visualizations of viewership by generational segments (e.g., Kids, Teens, Adults, Older), though specific details are limited due to repetitive OCR output.

**Interpretation**:
- Based on the R script's `categorize_age` function, this page likely segments viewership by age groups, revealing preferences (e.g., Kids prefer animated content, Teens favor action).
- Helps Netflix target content production and marketing to specific demographics.
- Indicates opportunities to expand content for underrepresented segments, such as Older viewers.

### Page 4: Netflix vs. Amazon Prime (Genre Comparison)

**Content**: Compares total genre content available on Netflix and Amazon Prime, likely using bar charts to highlight genre distribution.

**Interpretation**:
- Identifies Netflix's strengths in genres like Drama and Sci-Fi, where it has more exclusive content than Amazon Prime.
- Highlights gaps in genres like Action, where Amazon Prime may offer more variety.
- Suggests Netflix could diversify its genre portfolio to compete more effectively, particularly in high-demand genres.

### Page 5: Netflix vs. Amazon Prime (Market Trends)

**Content**: Visualizes global streaming market trends in billions, including revenue and subscriber growth for Netflix and Amazon Prime over the years.

**Interpretation**:
- Shows Netflix's stronger revenue growth compared to Amazon Prime, driven by its focus on originals and global expansion.
- Subscriber growth trends indicate Netflix's dominance in regions like Asia Pacific, but Amazon Prime's competitive pricing poses a challenge in price-sensitive markets.
- Recommends Netflix optimize pricing strategies in regions like Latin America to maintain growth.

### Page 6: Genre Recommendations Driven by Viewer Analytics

**Content**: Presents genre recommendations based on viewer analytics, e.g., suggesting Dark Sci-Fi for Europe, Middle East, and Africa in 2020 based on watched genres.

**Interpretation**:
- Leverages Apriori rules to recommend genres that align with regional viewing patterns (e.g., Sci-Fi → Thriller in Europe).
- Supports content acquisition and production decisions to maximize viewer satisfaction.
- Indicates Netflix should prioritize region-specific content to enhance engagement and retention.
